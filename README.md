# Project Overview :
This project leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to predict stock prices based on historical market data. The predictive model aims to assist investors and traders in making informed decisions by forecasting future stock price movements.

# Features :
- Predicts future stock prices using time series and regression models.
- Uses historical data for training and validation.
- Implements machine learning algorithms such as LSTM, RNN, or other regression models.
- Provides visualization of predicted vs. actual stock prices.
- Supports various stocks and customizable input parameters.

# Technologies Used :
- Python programming language
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations

# Usage :
- Load historical stock price data.
- Train the model or use a pre-trained model.
- Get predicted stock prices and compare against actual prices.
- Use visualizations for deeper insight.
